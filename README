reciprocity
===========

reciprocity is an anonymous recipe manager and nutrition calculator. It is free
software [1], distributed under the GNU General Public License [2].

I wrote this program to help me tabulate the damage caused by my adventures in
weight loss and cooking. I run an instance [3] of it on the Azure free tier for
my personal use. You are free to use this instance, but be warned that Azure
suspends the application when it is not in use, which frequently results in high
latency.
